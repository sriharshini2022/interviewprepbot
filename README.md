# 💬 AI-Powered Interview Preparation Bot

From a confused AIML student to the creator of an AI-powered interview preparation tool — this project is built to help students **prepare smarter, not harder**.

## 🎯 Purpose
As a final-year B.Tech AIML student, preparing for placements felt overwhelming. Between coding platforms, aptitude books, and behavioral prep materials, there was no structured way to improve or track progress. So, I built this:

A **Streamlit-based interview preparation bot** that:
- Generates real-world interview questions
- Provides instant AI feedback
- Tracks your progress over time
